# Project Details

Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.

Visitors are randomly be assigned to one of two groups:

+ Group A is still asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer.
+ Group B skips the fitness test and proceed directly to the application.

Janetâ€™s hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub than visitors assigned to Group A.

So that the null and alternate hypotheses are as follows:

1. Null Hypothesis = There will no difference between the visitors in Group A that purchase membership and the visitors in Group B that purchase membership.
2. Alternate Hypothesis = There will be more visitors in Group B that will purchase membership than visitors in Group A that will purchase membership.

The significance threshold we will set as the benchmark to either accept or fail to reject the null hypothesis will be:
$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$
