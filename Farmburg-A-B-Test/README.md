# Project details:

Brian ran an A/B test with three different groups: A, B, and C. He has provided us with a CSV file of his results named clicks.csv. It has the following columns:

- user_id: a unique id for each visitor to the FarmBurg site
- group: either 'A', 'B', or 'C' depending on which group the visitor was assigned to
- is_purchase: either 'Yes' if the visitor made a purchase or 'No' if they did not.
