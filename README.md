## Project Highlights

### <a id="1-ab-analytics-on-various-projects">1. A/B Analytics on various projects</a>
**Objective:** Forecast sales and optimize inventory management.  
**Key Highlights:**  
- Preprocessed and cleaned a large dataset with missing values and outliers.
- Visualized trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- UNderstanding and implementing hypothesis and statistical methods.

### <a id="2-simple-linear-regression">2. Simple Linear Regression model</a>
**Objectives:** Understanding the equation and how to set up a quick model to predict various data parameters for tennis matches.
**Key Highlights:**
- Data pre-processing and cleaning, understanding basic correlation with a heatmap
- Created a basic model to determine the coefficient of determination ($$ \R^2 $$ )
- Adjusted the value based on many independent variables to create a multiple linear regresspon model
$$
\begin{\equation} 
    \y = \beta_\0 + \beta_\1x_1 + \beta_\2x_2 + \dots + \beta_kx_k + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Where:
- ( y ) is the dependent variable.
- ( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k ) are the independent variables (predictors).
- ( \beta_0 ) is the y-intercept (constant term).
- ( \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_k ) are the regression coefficients.
- ( \epsilon ) is the error term.

Feel free to adapt it to your specific needs!

### <a id="3-multiple-linear-regression">3. Multiple Linear Regression</a>
**Objective:** Using multiple linear regression to highlight predictors for forest fires.
<br>

**Key Highlights:**
- To be added

### 4. Sentiment Analysis Using NLP
**Objective:** Analyze customer sentiment from reviews.  
**Key Highlights:**  
- Conducted text preprocessing including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- Employed bag-of-words and TF-IDF vectorization methods.
- Trained classifiers like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines for sentiment prediction.

### 5. Image Classification with CNNs
**Objective:** Classify images into predefined categories.  
**Key Highlights:**  
- Used transfer learning with pretrained models like VGG16 and ResNet.
- Augmented datasets with techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming.
- Achieved high accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and optimizing the model.

### 6. Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data
**Objective:** Detect anomalies in sensor data to prevent equipment failure.  
**Key Highlights:**  
- Explored time series data using moving averages and exponential smoothing.
- Built unsupervised models using techniques like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders.
- Deployed a real-time monitoring dashboard with visualization tools.
