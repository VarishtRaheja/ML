# Project Scenario
<p>

1. Task 1
    - Import required libraries
    - Read the dataset
2. Task 2
    - Create an application layout
    - Add title to the dashboard application using HTML H1 component

## Example:
### 1. Scatter Plot
Let us use a scatter plot to represent departure time changes with respect to airport distance.
This plot should contain the following

- Title as **Distance vs Departure Time**.
- x-axis label should be **Distance**
- y-axis label should be **DeptTime**
- **Distance** column data from the flight delay dataset should be considered in x-axis
- **DepTime** column data from the flight delay dataset should be considered in y-axis
- Scatter plot markers should be of any color

---

Our dashboard application consists of three components:

+ Title of the application
+ Component to enter input year
+ A chart conveying Total number of flights to the destination state.
